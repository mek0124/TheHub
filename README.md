    Hi! Im Mek. I have been a developer for going on a decade now. I started my adventure when I first started college, roughly 2016-2017. It was going to be my first calculator application using the Java language. Not too far in, I gave up and let that dream go as Java had just too much boiler-plate code for me at that time. About a year, almost two, passed when I moved to philly and hung out with Kastien for a while. I was introduced to Python and fell in love with programming. Throughout the years to pass, I have had some difficulty in learning where I would prefer to specifically work, however, to some degree I have learned that I enjoy front-end web development. I'm not too great with the back-end stuff using frameworks like Python's FastAPI or Node's Express JS. It's just a bit too...."big bites"....for me. THe part I'm more so referring to is the user authentication part. I'm just not yet comfortable with being responsible for authenticating users who interact with my applications, however, for the advancement of my career I am learning it.
